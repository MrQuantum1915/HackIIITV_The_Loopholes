# Project Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through setting up the project on your local machine. The only requirement is having Node.js and npm installed, and we recommend using nvm (Node Version Manager) for managing Node.js versions.

## Prerequisites

The only requirement is having Node.js & npm installed

## Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>
    ```

    Replace `<YOUR_GIT_URL>` with the project's Git URL.

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>
    ```

    Replace `<YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>` with the name of the project directory.

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm i
    ```

4.  **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will start the development server, providing auto-reloading and an instant preview of the project.
